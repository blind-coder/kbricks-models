# kbricks models

**kbricks** (pronounced *"kay-bricks"*) is a fully 3d-printable, open source construction system. It allows for building stable models that don't fall into pieces when playing with them. kbricks parts can be printed with almost any state-of-the-art 3d printer.

This repository will contain growing collection of models that can be built from kbricks parts.
